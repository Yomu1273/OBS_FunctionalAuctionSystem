# OBS_FunctionalAuctionSystem
It is functional auction website. It combines Ecommerce with auction principles.
A user can have multiple roles from bidding to selling their product. Each user is tracked with their session, their history of bids and current running bids are noted for their convinience.
Each bid consists of a base amount and a bid amount. When the user opens the site, they can view all current auctions. The auctions are sorted in a way that the bid which ends soon is displayed in the front.
This makes it more easier for the sellers to get attention before the auction ends.
A bidder can bid with the step amount how much ever times they want. The seller can look at the details of current highest bidder and the highest bid amount.
Each user can keep track of their personal details, amount of money left, first accessed and last accesed date an time.
It has a wallet feature, with which the user can update the balance and spend money based on it.
If a bidder has less amount in wallet than the bid step amount, he cannot bid for that particular product.

The site is responsive and modern.
The frontend is made using HTML, CSS, JS. NodeJS is used for server side and it also includes MongoDB for the backend.
